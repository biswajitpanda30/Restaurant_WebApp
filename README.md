# Restaurant_WebApp
 Restaurant_WebApp - Web crawler in python

My online delivery website should contain menus of three restaurants and a web crawler that crawls the restaurants menus every 24 hours to check for any update in the menu and subsequently updates it in my website. So customersâ€™ orders from the latest menu from my website.
